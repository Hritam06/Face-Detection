# Face-Detection

### I have made a Human Face Detector using Python and OpenCV.

### Please read the `Comments` in the `FACE.py` file and this `README.md` to successfully use this `Face Detection App`

<br> <br>


### Please run the following commands in your Terminal before executing the `FACE.py` file :-

1)    `pip install numpy`
2)    `pip install opencv-python`
3)    `pip install opencv-contrib-python`



### I have also uploaded the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file which contains all the factors of Human Face for detection.

You can donwload the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file by just opening the file from `GitHub` and then clicking the `Raw` button and then `Save` the `haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml` file in the same directory in which your `FACE.py` is saved.




### After following each and every step and after reading  the `README.md` and the `Comments` in the code, you are all set to use this `Face Detection App`...!!!
